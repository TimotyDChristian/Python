#Unfortunately, Matplotlib doesn't have a built-in function to generate word clouds. However, a Python package already exists in Python for generating word clouds. The package, called word_cloud was developed by Andreas Mueller.
#First, let's install the package

# install wordcloud
!conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud==1.4.1 --yes

# import python matplotlib library, package and its set of stopwords
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


print ('Wordcloud is installed, imported, and reeady to go!')
