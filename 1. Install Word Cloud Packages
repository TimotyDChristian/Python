#Unfortunately, Matplotlib doesn't have a built-in function to generate word clouds. However, a Python package already exists in Python for generating word clouds. The package, called word_cloud was developed by Andreas Mueller.
#First, let's install the packages

# install wordcloud
!conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud==1.4.1 --yes

# import package and its set of stopwords
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS

print ('Wordcloud is installed, imported, and reeady to go!')
